CORNER DETECTION:
An Implementation of Edward Rosten's FAST Corner Detection Method

The FAST Corner Detection method is a segment-test detector that finds corners in an image.  We run through the image with a contiguous arc of pixels where, if there are more than "n" contiguous pixels brighter than the center of the arc, we have a possible corner. We chose to implement this algorithm where n = 12

By implementing a "20 questions" sort of implementation, we are able to reduce the amount of time it takes to analyze each arc. Only after the arc passes all tests do we denote p as a possible corner.

Non-maximal suppression is used to solve the problem of having corners clustered together.

We chose to implement the n = 12 FAST detector with non-max suppression

The only main flaw of this implementation is its dependency on a threshold. We hope that since we are using the same camera for our system, we wold be able to solve for a good thresholding value that will give us consistent results.
